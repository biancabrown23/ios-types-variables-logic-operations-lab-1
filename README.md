17 % 4 == 1 // This is true // 

25 % 4 != 1 // This is false //

81 % 9 != 840 % 2 // This is false //

(14 % 2 < 4) || (243 % 13 > 2) || (52 % 3 > 5) // This is true // 
```

***
## 5. Which of the follow is true?

a)
```swift
let numOne = 4.0
let numTwo = 4.0
let a = numOne == numTwo
```

b)
```swift
let numThree = 24/5
let numFour = 24.0/5.0
let b = numThree == numFour
```
c)
```swift
let numFive = 24%5
let numSix = 24.0%5.0
let c = numFive == numSix
```
d)
```swift
let numSeven = 4.0 + 1.2
let numEight = 5.0 + .2
let d = numSeven == numEight
```
The answer is A.
***
## 6. What is the final value of i?
